  "summary": "The diff does not implement production deployment or any deployment-output changes to print the required .icp0.io URL line. It mainly updates backend canister code and updates project_state.json to track the requests as pending.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Perform a production deployment (not a preview build) so the app is accessible publicly, and provide the final public frontend URL in the deployment output in the exact format: \"Your production canister is live at: https://<canister-id>.icp0.io\".",
      "reason": "No changes in the diff indicate a production deployment was executed or that deployment output was modified to print the exact required line/URL format. The only related mention is in project_state.json where the request is marked pending.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Fix the deployment feedback/output so that production deployments reliably include the final public .icp0.io live link line.",
      "reason": "There are no modifications to deployment tooling, scripts, CI, or output formatting shown in the diff. project_state.json notes the issue but does not implement a fix.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest non-goals explicitly exclude implementing new product features beyond deployment/output visibility; the backend code changes appear to add/modify application domain functionality rather than deployment behavior.",

      "description": "Tracking the deployment requests as pending feature requests in project_state.json without implementing them.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest asks to deploy and fix output; updating internal project tracking is not requested as a deliverable and does not satisfy the deployment/output requirements.",
